# A (Buggy) Todo Application

This intentionally buggy react-application was built to facilitate interviews for Front-end Developer positions. Specifically, this application can be used in an interview setting to see how candidates approach real-time debugging of an existing application. In addition to to seeing how well candidates can identify bugs in an existing application, this exercise allows interviewers to gauge how candidates go about their debugging process and operate in a collaborative setting.

## Necessary Tools

Before getting started on this projects, users will need the following applications installed:
- Git, for cloning the repository;
- Node/npm, for running the application.


## Getting Started

To get started, users must install all dependent packages in order for the project to build successfully. This can be done by opening a terminal instance in your locally cloned copy of this project and running the following:

```bash
npm install
```

The project can be built locally by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will make the local version of this application accessible, likely at `localhost:3000`. A message from the command line should confirm where the application is hosted. Additionally, this will launch the application in a watch-state, so that any future changes to the local code should trigger a rebuild of the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Then uses the `gh-pages` package to push this build folder to the `gh-pages` branch\,
which triggers an auto-deployment of the app through GitHub Pages.
